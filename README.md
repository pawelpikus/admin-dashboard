## My process

### What I learned

I've practiced the use of Hooks (useState, useEffect) and calling APIs with axios. Validated the input values with <code>regex pattern</code> attribute.

I utilised the power of Redux toolkit and Thunk. I've practice the usual flow of a redux app, from creating store to actions and reducers. I successfully dispatched the actions in basic CRUD operations.
I used Typescript in development.
